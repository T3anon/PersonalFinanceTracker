I will explain in our next meeting on thursday or i will message you your stuff is under "profile"

To be able to do this and see what it is under do this in terminal:

npm i
npm run dev

Your code is under personalfinancetracker/app/profile

After this you will be able to access the website off of a localhost and see it. The main page is the page.tsx and then everything in the folders would be at the search bar /"folder name" yours for example would be http://localhost:3000/profile after you run npm i and npm run dev.

This allows for better understanding of what you are doing after you save the file refresh the localhost page and it will show you what changed.

docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres
